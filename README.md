oObject is:
- standard class object
- enumerable class object
- map storing keys and value
- does it make sense to restrict map fields
- but a prototypal map does make sense
- map may prototype to standard object as well
map -> standard object (encapsulate?)
- prototype can in main oObject, or is each part
- what about objects inside objects (for tostring)
